# Video Semantic Search

Text Search: The goal is to recognize the text contained in each frame of the video.
Semantic Search: Using deep learning visual models to identify the elements present in each frame, allowing me to search for them.

For example, if a frame in the video shows a scene of a child eating an apple, with the word “banana” written on the child’s clothes, searching for “apple,” “child,” or “banana” would all return the position of that particular frame in the video.
Overall Architecture:

	•	GUI Framework: PyQt6
	•	Backend: Python for video processing and executing deep learning tasks.

Main Components:

a) Video Processing
b) Text Recognition (OCR)
c) Image Semantic Analysis
d) Search Engine
e) User Interface

Required Libraries:

	•	PyQt6 (GUI framework)
	•	OpenCV (cv2) (Video processing)
	•	Pytesseract (Text recognition)
	•	Torch and Torchvision (Deep learning)
	•	Transformers (CLIP model)
	•	SQLite3 (Local data storage)

Implementation Approach:

a) Video Processing:

	•	Use OpenCV to break the video into frames.
	•	Process and analyze each frame.

b) Text Recognition:

	•	Use Pytesseract to perform OCR on each frame.
	•	Store the recognized text along with its timestamp in the video.

c) Image Semantic Analysis:

	•	Use a pre-trained YOLO model for object detection.
	•	Use the CLIP model for broader semantic understanding.
	•	Store the detected objects/concepts along with their timestamps in the video.

d) Search Engine:

	•	Build an index containing the results of text recognition and semantic analysis.
	•	Implement a search function to find relevant frames based on text or semantic concepts.

e) User Interface:

	•	Use PyQt6 to build the interface.
	•	Provide features for video upload, search, and displaying results.
